The two major steps in the learning framework are: 

1. Spectral projection and smoothing 
2. PDE learning 

The codes provided need to be run sequentially to execute the above steps. The details are provided below. The starting point is the data provided in `data/`, which corresponds to the results presented in Fig. 4 of the manuscript.
